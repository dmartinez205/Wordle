Wordle! by Daniel Martinez
Final project for CS 1210 at UVM

Description
In the program, you guess attempt to guess a five letter word within six attempts.
Letters highlighted in yellow are in the word but not in the correct position, letters highlighted in green are in the word and in the correct position.
Letters that aren't in the word at all are highlighted as white and displayed as a list of incorrect letters.
If you fail to guess the word within six attempts you lose but if you guess the word within the six attempts you win.
Once you complete a game you have the option to play again or quit.

 
Instructions
Once you type a five letter word in the list of words provided you press enter and the highlighting is displayed.
You do this until you win or lose.
Type q to quit or y to play again.
To test the program, you can try typing words of different lengths
Type word = 'your testing word' the line after the random word selection.
